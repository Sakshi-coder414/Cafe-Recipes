My Favorite Chocolate Brands:
Guittard – My absolute favorite, and a good balance of affordability and quality. Pretty easy to find, and I get mine at Whole Foods or Target.

Callebaut  – I tend to only find this in big block form, at Whole Foods or other specialty stores. 

Scharffen Berger – Harder to find but great quality. I have the least experience with this one but every type I’ve had has great flavor.

Vahlrona – Available in lots of different forms, and very high quality. Also harder to find.

Ghirardelli – Not as high end as the others but still good, and probably the most widely available quality brand. Pretty affordable.
