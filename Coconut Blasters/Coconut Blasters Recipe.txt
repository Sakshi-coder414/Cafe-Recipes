INGREDIENTS
Yield: 4 ounces

111 milliliters (about 3 3/4 ounces) Everclear (190 proof)
39 milliliters (about 1 1/3 ounces) water
75 grams (2/3 cup) organic unrefined coconut oil
2 #2 conical coffee filters
DIRECTIONS
Weigh 39 grams of water in a measuring cup, then add Everclear until the total volume is 150 mL  (1 gram of water = 1 ml).
Heat coconut oil in hot Bain Marie (or double boiler, or a metal bowl placed over a pan of boiling water) until it becomes liquid and is completely clear.
Add oil to the Everclear-water solution and stir.
Allow to macerate for a minimum of 5 hours, stirring (or shaking) occasionally.
Place in freezer overnight. (While coconut oil can solidify within an hour or two, the cleanest/purest results have been as a result of longer freezing times).
Remove the solidified fat and discard.
Fold the seams of a #2 conical coffee filter and strain Coconut Blast.
Discard filter, and repeat the straining process with the second filter. Store in a dasher bottle.
