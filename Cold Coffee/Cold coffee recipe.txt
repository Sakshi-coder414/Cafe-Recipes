Coffee Powder – You can use any instant coffee powder of your choice to make this drink. You can even go for cold brew or filter coffee. I prefer to use instant coffee powder, as it is easily available, easy to use, and tastes delicious.

Milk – For the creamiest version of coffee, use full cream (whole) milk. You can even use low-fat milk or skim milk, but the texture won’t be as creamy as the full cream one.

For a vegan version, instead of dairy milk, you can go for non-dairy options such as almond milk, soy milk, coconut milk, oats milk, or any other vegan milk that you prefer.

Sugar – Add sugar as per your taste. You can increase or decrease the quantity of the same.

Milk Powder – The addition of milk powder, will add an extra creamy texture to your coffee. In case you are making a vegan version, you can just skip adding it.
